# Advanced-todo

A web-based to-do list and project management application.

This project is inspired by the Trello application, but everything is originally made by me.
The reason why I made this app is just that other apps were not user-friendly and intuitive enough for me.

Project contains two versions: Simple and Advanced

:heavy_check_mark: **Simple** version is **Done**.
:x: **Advanced** version still **in development**.

The project is still in production and not finished right now.
